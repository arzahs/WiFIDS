	"View Log" on web interface doesn't show the log - just the devplan.
	To be fair, we're actually not logging at the moment. Maybe start making this happen on startup?

	Sendmail on motion event fails if no unauthorized devices have been observed.
	Possibly circumvent with a try:, or move email action to unauthorized device vs. motion.

	Motion detection is freaking out after a while and then triggering tons of events.  Not sure of cause yet.
	Somewhat fixed, but not entirely on 2015-03-19. Counting a loop of image caps. Probably a better way. -Garrett

	Seems to be a long time between when motion is detected and when camera takes pictures.
	Can we speed this up? Maybe remove some initialization steps?
	Somewhat improved on 4-27-2015, but still not perfect.

	An ESSID or Probe or OUI contains an 8-bit encoded character (unicode?)  Causes the following:
	ProgrammingError: You must not use 8-bit bytestrings unless you use a text_factory that can interpret 8-bit bytestrings (like text_factory = str). 
	It is highly recommended that you instead just switch your application to Unicode strings.
	Possibly fixed on 2015-03-19 through use of connection.text_factory = str on db. Some probe must have had a weird Unicode ESSID.

	Deauth emails go CRAZY since the logic runs for each packet received. 
	Currently storing/checking a record of sending a message in the db.  
	Is there a way to keep this in memory yet have it stay persistent for every run of runsniffer() (every packet)?

	Images are being sent with no filename. This is due to a missing argument in image = MIMEImage(imagedata, xxxx).

2015-02-25 - Garrett
	Found an issue where emailing multiple photos in succession can get corrupted.  
	Actual file is being written to disk fine. Maybe sleeps would fix it?

2015-02-10 - Garrett
	Fixed a bug where MAC lookups were no longer working.

2015-02-09 - Garrett
	main.py is using 100% of memory and swap after 20-30 minutes of running, rendering pi inoperable. 
	Suggest increasing RAM or making script more efficient (or both).
